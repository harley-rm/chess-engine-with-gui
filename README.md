# chess-engine-with-gui

This is a chess engine and GUI completed for A-Level Computer Science coursework. It was created entirely in VB.NET, and uses assets (i.e. piece images, opening dictionary, and more) which are referenced in the writeup section of the project.

The code is by no means the best solution to the task, however some decisions had to be made to ensure that the deadline was met.
